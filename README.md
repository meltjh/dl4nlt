# Data
The folders aclImdb and glove need to be in the 'processing' folder.    
Run preprocess_data.py to get the processed data embedded and divided into training, validation and test set.

# Train
The models are trained by running train_model.py.

# Testing
Move the trained model that needs to be tested to evaluation/final_models.    
There are already 3 pretrained models in the folder.     
Run evaluate to get the results on the test set.
